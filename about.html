        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm a data scientist, stats geek, analyst, husband, and lifelong gamer.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Where Am I?</h2>
                <p>A native of the Midwest, I have lived all over but currently reside in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>What Do I Do?</h2>
                <p>I love narrative, be it from a book, movie, or game. I also love data. Put the two together and
                my passion is to create stories from numbers in order to drive business and content decisions. I
                am also a creative person myself, and I enjoy learning about and developing tools and dashboards
                that people can use to wrest the meaning from complex data.</p>
                <p>If you have a data that needs curious, creative, curated handling, look no further.</p>

            <h2>A little more about me...</h2>
                <p>My background is in academia. I worked as an atmospheric scientist before I realized that I wanted
                to use my computer and mathematical knowledge to work directly with customers, data, products, and
                development. Now, my dream is to combine my passion for content development with data science
                to drive business decisions in a creative industry.</p>
                <p>In my free time, you will likely find me playing piano, composing music, watching movies (probably Star Wars) with my
                family, reading, or enjoying a board/video game with friends.</p>
