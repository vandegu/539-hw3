        <h2>Background info:</h2>
            <p>I am a data scientist/analyst with experience in scientific programming, data visualization, and
            reporting. My goal is to work with data in an environment where the insights from my work
            directly impact the decisions being made with regard to business direction, product design, and
            content development.</p>

            <h3>Python development</h3>
                <p>I have worked with Python since 2014, have taught graduate-level classes on Python,
                and written code for machine learning, analytics, data visualization, web development,
                and scientific research.</p>

            <img src="./images/icons/baseline-trending_up-24px.svg", alt="Icon for statistical inference.">
            <h3>Statistical inference</h3>
                <p>I have used bayesian techniques and machine learning to make inferences and extract patterns
                from complex data. I have written code to analyze data for research, classwork, and as a freelance data analyst for a board game
                develpment company.</p>

            <img src="./images/icons/baseline-picture_in_picture_alt-24px.svg", alt="Icon for app development.">
            <h3>App development</h3>
                <p>I have developed web applications to manage databases, and display the data meaningfully and
                aesthetically.</p>

            <img src="./images/icons/db.svg", alt="Icon for database management.">
            <h3>Database management</h3>
                <p>I am comfortable with SQL and its various flavors. I am experienced in building database systems
                from provided data, data scraped from the web, and more.</p>

            <img src="./images/icons/baseline-settings_ethernet-24px.svg", alt="Icon for machine learning.">
            <h3>Machine learning</h3>
                <p>I am comfortable with using popular machine learning techniqes to analyze a dataset. I can build
                Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo simulations to infer the patterns within data, convolutional neural networks
                to exploit the relationships between parameters, natural language processing algorithms to
                automate processes, and more.</p>

            <img src="./images/icons/baseline-bug_report-24px.svg", alt="Icon for web crawling.">
            <h3>Web crawling</h3>
                <p>I am not afraid to get my hands dirty and work hard to find data. I have used python packages such as
                Beautiful Soup and Selenium to crawl through hundreds of webpages for the data necessary to train my
                models.</p>

            <img src="./images/icons/baseline-bar_chart-24px.svg", alt="Icon for data visualization.">
            <h3>Data visualization</h3>
                <p>With my background in academia, I am no stranger to creating beautiful plots to succinctly and
                aesthetically display data so that key inferences can be deciphered easily. I have used Matplotlib,
                Plotly, and other programs to create these figures.</p>

            <img src="./images/icons/baseline-assignment-24px.svg", alt="Icon for report writing.">
            <h3>Report writing</h3>
                <p>I enjoy writing, and am not afraid of it. I have prepared numerous professional reports in my time,
                including but not limited to scientific publications.</p>
